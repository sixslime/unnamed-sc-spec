# Why?

In general, abiding by a strict rules may seem like an uneccessary hassle, and it may be if you are the *only one* abiding by them. However, if *multiple people* choose to follow the same set of rules, each person knows exactly what to expect from the others, and ideally, the benefits of this mutual understanding (especially over time) far outweigh the overhead of abiding by such rules.

Regarding SC specifically, SC is designed such that: In addition to being inherently understood on a base level by other SC developers, SC packs share a mutual understanding between *themselves*. In other words, SC maximizes compatibility and minimizes interference between SC packs (and to a lesser extent, between SC packs and non-SC datapacks), even if they do not explicitly know of each other. Thus, even if you are keen on being a solo developer who never uses anyone else's work, consider that implementing SC may benefit players that want to add your datapack to their world(s) alongside other datapacks.

### If You Are A Beginner To Commands:
It is actually recommended **against** attempting to implement SC. Trying to learn SC (or any sort of standard) before you have a basic understanding of commands is likely to only add further confusion.

However, if you are only new to **datapacks**, but somewhat experienced with commands, consider trying SC, it does not introduce anything unorthodox or against "normal" datapack structure (and may implicitly teach you good practices).

## Why SC Specifically?
For the same reason SC was made initially: *because there isn't anything else.*

At the time of writing, the generally accepted standard of datapacks are a collection of good practices/conventions that are largely unspoken and/or not formally documented. This leads to an environment where it is usually a headache (or worse) to integrate someone elses work/datapack with your own.

SC aims to be a step toward a datapack ecosystem where developers can share their work and use others' shared work efficiently and fearlessly. Whether this is directly through widespread adoption of SC or through other means is not important, what matters is that *something* is done.
