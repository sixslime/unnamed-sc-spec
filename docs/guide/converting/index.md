# Converting Your Datapack

Implementing SC on an existing datapack is **straightforward** and can be done programatically. 
This guide serves as a step-by-step through the process, as well as a general guide to everything in SC.

The following is recommended but not required:

- A tool for searching and replacing text across many files (e.g., `ctrl+shift+h` in VSCode).
- A backup of your original datapack.
- This guide is followed in the order it is organized in.
- If you are reading this guide for the first time, use a small to medium sized datapack as a test subject if possible.
