# Converting Your Datapack

Implementing SC on an existing datapack is straightforward and can be done programatically.

Each page in this guide is split into two sections (denoted by a horizontal line). The first section provides the relevant **actionable steps** required in the datapack conversion process, while the second provides the relevant **general explanation** of the specification. Reading this guide fully and in-order should provide you with near-complete knowledge of SC.

The following is recommended but not required:

- A tool for searching and replacing text across many files (e.g., `ctrl+shift+h` in VSCode).
- A backup of your original datapack.
- If this is your first time reading this guide, use a small to medium sized datapack as a test subject if possible.
