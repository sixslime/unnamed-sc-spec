# Converting Your Datapack

Implementing SC on an existing datapack is **straightforward** and can be done programatically. This guide serves to step you through the process, as well as to teach you everything you need to know and understand to continue using SC.

The following is recommended but not required:

- A tool for searching and replacing text across many files (e.g., `ctrl+shift+h` in VSCode).
- A backup of your original datapack.
- This guide is followed in the order it is organized in.
