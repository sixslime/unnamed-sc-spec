# Introduction

Welcome to the guide and partial reference to an unnamed datapack specification, further referred too as **SC**.

While SC itself is hypothetically complete, these pages only serve to communicate the idea of SC in full, not as definitive documentation.

Datapacks that comply with SC will be referred to as **SC packs**.
