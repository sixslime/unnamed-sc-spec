# Introduction


Welcome to the guide and partial documentation to an unnamed datapack specification, further referred to as **SC**.

### What Do You Mean By "Datapack Specification"?


## Who Is SC For?
Strictly speaking, SC is ideal for datapack developers that desire to use datapacks created by others and/or publish their own datapacks for others to use.

SC has the practical potential, however, to benefit any player that plays with more than one datapack in their world.


## What does SC Do?

## Objective of SC
Informally:
> Make developing, publishing, and utilizing datapacks published by others as **painless as possible**.

Formally:

* Provide clear rules for defining and utilizing intended cross-datapack interactions.
* Provide clear guidelines that serve to reduce unintended cross-datapack interference as much as possible.
* Provide a proper package-management system, including:
    * dependency indication
    * versioning
    * publishing

This specification aims to achieve these objectives with the following principles: (highest to lowest priority)

1. Require no third party programs to realistically implement.
2. Be as robust as possible.
3. Be as unintrusive as possible.
4. Be as intuitive/accessible as possible.
